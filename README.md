# Overview
The goal of this repository is to provide an alternative implementation of the beacon chain 
that was recently announced by the Ethereum Core dev team. As even the Ethereum Core dev team don't know how the finalized beacon chain
will be implemented, this is our contribution to the effort to transitioning Ethereum from a PoW blockchain to a PoS blockchain.
